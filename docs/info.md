## How it works

It gives a circuit diagram for F = AB + C'. Outputs are x, y and inputs
are A, B, C

## How to test

Refer to the truth table of F = AB + C’.
#25 A=0; B=0; C=0;
#25 A=0; B=0; C=1;
#25 A=0; B=1; C=0;
#25 A=0; B=1; C=1;
#25 A=1; B=0; C=0;
#25 A=1; B=0; C=1;
#25 A=1; B=1; C=0;
#25 A=1; B=1; C=1;

## External hardware

List external hardware used in your project (e.g. PMOD, LED display, etc), if any
